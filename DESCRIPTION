Description: Connections and tools for algebraic statistics in R.
    Current applications include exact inference in log-linear models for
    contingency table data, analysis of ranked and partially ranked data, and
    general purpose tools for multivariate polynomials, building on the mpoly
    package. To aid in the process, algstat has ports to Macaulay2, Bertini,
    LattE-integrale and 4ti2.
